select concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as 'Actor Name' from actor;

-- 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
select actor_id, first_name, last_name from actor where first_name = 'Joe';
-- 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN:
select * from actor where last_name like '%gen%';

-- 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO. Otherwise, change the first name to MUCHO GROUCHO, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO MUCHO GROUCHO, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)
update actor set first_name=replace(first_name, 'GROUCHO', 'HARPO'), first_name=replace(first_name, 'HARPO', 'MUCHO GROUCHO') where last_name='williams';
